        "Quaternions are four-dimensional hypercomplex numbers which offer a powerful approach to orientation tracking because of their capacity for representing three-dimensional rotations. Specifically, a single unit quaternion can represent any 3d rotation without the common pitfalls of other rotation representations, such as gimbal lock. Moreover, quaternions allow for efficient and numerically stable calculations, especially beneficial in real-time tracking contexts like gait analysis. The quaternion-based approach simplifies the compounding of rotations by encapsulating complex rotational transformations in quaternion multiplication, reducing the risk of drift and improving accuracy in sensor fusion algorithms. This capability makes quaternions particularly well-suited for the recursive nature of state estimation models, where orientation data from consecutive IMU measurements need to be seamlessly integrated over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quaternions also support interpolation methods such as spherical linear interpolation (SLERP), which preserves the shortest path of rotation and minimizes error, critical in applications like gait analysis where precise orientation tracking is needed. This combination of stability, efficiency, and the ability to handle continuous rotations makes quaternions an optimal choice for robust and reliable orientation tracking in IMU-based gait analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quaternions represent orientation through a four-dimensional structure that encodes three-dimensional rotation in a single unit quaternion, typically denoted $q = w + xi + yj + zk$, where $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are real numbers and $i$, $j$, and $k$, are imaginary units. To represent a rotation, a quaternion should be normalized (i.e., has a unit magnitude), which ensures that it purely represents rotation without scaling effects. To represent an orientation, a quaternion is computed based on a rotation axis and angle: a rotation of $\\theta$ around an axis defined by a unit vector $(x, y, z)$ is represented as $q = \\cos(\\theta/2) + (xi, yj, zk)\\sin(\\theta/2)$. When applied to a vector (using quaternion multiplcation), this quaternion rotates it by the specified angle around the given axis. Quaternion multiplication combines two rotations in sequence, making it useful for updating orientations. Given two quaternions $q_1 = w_1 + x_1i + y_1j + z_1k$ and $q_2 = w_2 + x_2i + y_2j + z_2k$, their product $q = q_1 \\cdot q_2$ results in a new quaternion that represents the combined rotation of $q_1$ followed by $q_2$. The product $q = q_1 \\otimes q_2$ is calculated using the formula:\n",

        "The g-h filter is a recursive algorithm used to estimate the state of dynamic systems from noisy measurements. One of its applications is tracking the position and velocity of objects. The g-h filter helps smooth out this noisy data by using two parameters, g (alpha) and h (beta), to adjust the level of filtering applied to the position and velocity estimates. By dynamically adjusting these parameters, the filter can be tuned to respond more or less aggressively to changes in the measured data, providing a balance between the system's predictions and real-time observations. This makes it particularly useful for systems where the state changes gradually over time. The g-h filter's simplicity and computational efficiency make it suitable for real-time applications, where computational resources may be limited. It offers a practical solution for integrating noisy sensor data with a predictive model to produce optimal state estimates, much like the Kalman Filter, but with fewer computational demands. Interestingly, the Kalman Filter can be viewed as an advanced version of the g-h filter, employing more sophisticated methods to dynamically update the g and h parameters. Starting with the g-h filter is an excellent entry point for building up to the more complex Kalman Filter, as it lays the foundational understanding of recursive filtering and state estimation. The following code performs a g-h filter on 1 state variable with a fixed g and h."
